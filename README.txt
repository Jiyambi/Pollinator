Pollinator - The Bee Game!

In Pollinator, you play as a bee who must gather pollen to provide his hive with honey for the winter.

Some levels span multiple seasons and years, adding additional dimensions to gameplay as you pollinate flowers to encourage and control their spread. To complicate things, pesticides drift in on the wind and can poison your hive. Obstacles, enemies and rival bees cause trouble as well, sometimes destroying the flowers you depend on to live. Can you keep your hive alive through the winter?
